## What is the feature

Introduce a new Sentry SDK specifically designed for Nuxt.js applications. This SDK will provide seamless integration with Nuxt's architecture, enabling comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring on both the client (Vue.js) and server (Nitro) sides. It will include instrumentation for Nuxt-specific libraries and features, such as Nitro, crossws, db0, and unstorage.

## Why we need the feature

Nuxt.js is a powerful framework for building Vue.js applications with server-side rendering, static site generation, and other advanced features. Currently, integrating Sentry into Nuxt projects requires manual setup and may not cover all nuances of Nuxt's ecosystem. By providing an official Nuxt SDK, we can:

- **Simplify Integration**: Offer a plug-and-play solution for developers to add Sentry to their Nuxt projects without extensive configuration.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Ensure that errors and performance issues are captured across both client and server environments, including Nuxt-specific components.
- **Support Nuxt Community**: Cater to the growing Nuxt user base by addressing their specific needs, thereby increasing Sentry's adoption in this community.
- **Enhance Developer Experience**: Reduce setup time and potential errors during integration, allowing developers to focus on building features.

## How to implement and why

**Step 1: Client-Side Instrumentation**

- **Implement**: Utilize the existing `@sentry/vue` package to handle error tracking and performance monitoring within Vue components.
- **Why**: Leverages familiar tools for Vue developers and ensures client-side errors are effectively captured.

**Step 2: Server-Side Instrumentation with Nitro**

- **Implement**: Develop OpenTelemetry (otel) instrumentation for Nuxt's Nitro server, enabling tracing and monitoring of server-side operations.
- **Why**: Nitro is the core server engine for Nuxt applications; instrumenting it allows for comprehensive server-side error and performance monitoring.

**Step 3: Instrument Nuxt-Specific Libraries**

- **Implement**:
  - **crossws**: Create instrumentation to monitor WebSocket communications via their wrapper.
  - **db0**: Add tracing for database operations through their database wrapper.
  - **unstorage**: Monitor key/value storage interactions.
- **Why**: These libraries are integral to many Nuxt applications; instrumenting them ensures visibility into crucial parts of the stack.

**Step 4: Create `sentryNuxtPlugin` for Error Handling**

- **Implement**: Develop a Nuxt plugin to automatically capture and report errors.
- **Why**: Simplifies error handling setup for developers by integrating directly with Nuxt's plugin system.

**Step 5: Source Map Support**

- **Implement**: Configure the build process to generate and upload source maps for both client and server code.
- **Why**: Source maps allow Sentry to provide readable stack traces, improving debugging efficiency.

**Step 6: Add E2E Tests**

- **Implement**: Develop end-to-end tests to verify the SDK's integration and functionality within Nuxt applications.
- **Why**: Ensures reliability and helps catch integration issues early in development.

**Step 7: Create Nuxt Platform in Sentry**

- **Implement**: Add Nuxt as a recognized platform within Sentry's platform selection.
- **Why**: Enhances the onboarding experience and ensures documentation and settings are tailored for Nuxt users.

**Step 8: Documentation and Setup Wizard**

- **Implement**: Write comprehensive documentation and possibly develop a setup wizard to guide users through integration.
- **Why**: Lowers the barrier to entry and reduces configuration errors, improving overall user satisfaction.

**Step 9: Ensure Deployment Compatibility**

- **Implement**: Test and validate the SDK's functionality on popular deployment platforms like Netlify and Vercel, including edge environments.
- **Why**: Nuxt applications are frequently deployed to these platforms; ensuring compatibility broadens the SDK's applicability.

**Step 10: Plan for Nuxt 4 Support**

- **Implement**: Stay informed about the development of Nuxt 4 and plan for any necessary changes.
- **Why**: Future-proofs the SDK and assures users of ongoing support.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**

- By starting with client-side instrumentation, we leverage existing tools and provide immediate value.
- Server-side instrumentation requires more customization due to Nuxt's unique server engine; focusing on Nitro ensures we cover the core server architecture.
- Instrumenting Nuxt-specific libraries addresses the unique aspects of Nuxt applications that generic Node.js or Vue.js instrumentation might miss.
- Adding plugins and tools like `sentryNuxtPlugin` and a setup wizard improves developer experience by simplifying the integration process.
- Ensuring compatibility with deployment platforms meets developers where they are and acknowledges the diverse environments in which Nuxt apps run.

## About backward compatibility

- **Maintain Support for Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3**: Ensure that the SDK is compatible with both Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3, recognizing that many projects may still be on older versions.
  - **Reason**: Provides a smooth upgrade path and doesn't alienate users on previous versions.
- **Non-Intrusive Integration**: Design the SDK so that it can be added without requiring significant changes to existing codebases.
  - **Reason**: Reduces the risk of integration and encourages adoption.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallbacks for features not supported in older environments.
  - **Reason**: Ensures that essential functionality remains operational, even if advanced features aren't available.
- **Documentation on Migration**: Provide clear guidance on how to migrate from manual Sentry integrations or older SDKs to the new Nuxt SDK.
  - **Reason**: Eases the transition process and helps prevent integration errors.

By focusing on backward compatibility, we respect the existing user base and promote broader adoption of the new SDK across different versions of Nuxt.
